#COMMENTS:  A comment is a text which we use to gives description during the coding. IDE does not print comments text
# as a code. It's shortcut key is ctrl + / or # symbol. if we apply comment before any text then python shows it as 
# text instead of code like.
# 
# print("Hello World")    It is a comment that's why it is not printing in terminal window.
# 
#   

print("Hello World!")
