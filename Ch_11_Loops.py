###LOOPS: WE HAVE TWO TYPES OF LOOPS 
# 01 - wHILE LOOPS.
# 02 - FOR LOOPS.

## while Loops: (it is used when want to repeat same task )

# n = 0                               #(Initialization)
# while n <= 10:                      #(Condition)
#     print("Zeeshan",n)              #(task which we want to repeat)
#     n = n+2                         #(INCREAMENT)

# ____________________________________________#


# i = 0
# while i <= 15:
#     print("Zeeshan", i)
#     i = i+1.5
#__________________________________________#


# i=0
# j=0
# while i <=2:
#     print("Muhammad")
#     i = i+1

# while j<=6:
#     print("Zeeshan") 
   
#     j=  j+1

#____________________________________________________________________________________#    
 
 ##FOR LOOPS:



# for i in ["M", "Z", "P", 95]:
#     print(i)

from bdb import Breakpoint


# d = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thur", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]

# for i in d:
#    # if (i == "Sat"):continue               # To skip value between the loop.
#     if (i == "Sat"):break                   # To break the loop.
#     print(i)
    
#_______________________________________________#

# for i in range(0,11):
#     print("Zeeshan",i)
