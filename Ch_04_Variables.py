###VARIABLES: We can use Variable to store something.

my_name = "Zeeshan"   #Here we stored or saved a name Zeeshan as variable (my_name).

  
print(my_name)        #IF we print my_name python show it's stored or assign value.

##A VARIABLE CAN BE AN ALPHABET OR STRING BUT NOT A NUMBER OR STRING STARTING WITH NUMBER AS SHOWN BELOW.
## RULES TO ASSIGN A VARIABLE:
#01 - The variables should contains letters, numbers or underscores(instead of Space).
#02 - DO not start with numbers.
#03 - Spaces are not allowed.
#04 - Dont use such keyword which already used for python like (len, del, type etc).
#05- A variable should be short and descriptive.
#06 - Variable is case sensitive.



x  = "Zeeshan"
y = " ALtaf"

print(x,y)


5 = " ZEESHAN"      #We can not a variable like this 

01-name = "Zeeshan"   # We can't also not defined variable like this.

name_01 = "Zeeshan"  # BUT We can define variable like this number after string.



x = 10
print (x+5)

###TYPE FUNCTION: Type function is a function which is use to check type of code either string, integes or else.

x = "Muhammad Zeeshan"
y = 505
z = 10.45


print (type(x))                 #it is class string 
print (type(y))                 #it is class integer
print (type(z))                 #it is class flat.


###LENGHT FUNCTION:  A lenght (len) function is used to check lenght of string. 

len(x)                   #MUhammad Zeeshan has 16 letters including space.
