 
### TYPES OF CONVERSION. Basically we have three types/Class of code.
# 01- Interger,  02- Float and 03- String.
# We can convert any type of coode into differnt type by using function.

import string


x = "Zeeshan"           # This is String type 
y = 10                  # This is an integer
z = 10.05               #This is float 

print(x,type(x))
print(y,type(y))
print(z,type(z))

#_______________________________________________________________#

a = input("What is your age?")
a = int(a) # Here age shows as string but convert into integer.
print (a, type(a))
